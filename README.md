## Quick Markdown tips (corrected)
Use backticks for code and code examples, e.g. `` `#` ``.

- Headings: `#` (H1) to `######` (H6).  
  Example: ``# Main heading`` â†’ **Note:** put a space after `#` (e.g. `# Heading`, not `#Heading`).

- Sub-headings: ``## Sub heading``

- Numbered lists: `1. First item` (there must be a space after the dot).

- Unordered lists: `- item` or `* item` (also add a space after `-`).

- Bold: `**this is bold**` (no extra spaces between the asterisks and the text).

- Italic: `*this is italic*` or `_this is italic_`.

- Inline code: `` `code` ``

- Code block (use triple backticks in your README if you want a fenced block):
